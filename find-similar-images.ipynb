    "# Identifying Similar Images with Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Douglas Duhaime wrote an [excellent tutorial](http://douglasduhaime.com/posts/identifying-similar-images-with-tensorflow.html). This notebook is my experiment trying to follow his steps, using a github repo and a jupyter binder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The repo is at [github](https://github.com/o-date/Identifying-Similar-Images-with-TensorFlow). The various python bits and pieces are called from the `requirements.txt` file, which saves us from having to `!pip install`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a bunch of images in \\images. In Duhaime's tutorial, he had a folder with 2000 images. I'm just going with 25 here because a) I'm impatient and b) I don't know how many I can push into github.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the modified classify script (which pulls out the second but last layer), and write it to the new `image_vectors` dir. Then cluster, then project. Then run the affinity propagation notebook, which is written in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acknowledgements\n",
    "\n",
    "My thanks to Douglas Duhaime for his clear explanation of how to use tensorflow to explore images this way. Katherine Davidson, Eric Hobson, and Ian Davidson tried these notebooks out under a variety of circumstances, trouble-shooting all the bugs that emerged as we went."
